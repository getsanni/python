x = 1
while x < 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
    
#Correct! After 3 runs, x will be equal to 4, causing x < 4 to evaluate to False. This means that the while loop is executed 3 times, giving three printouts.


# Initialize offset
offset = 8

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)

    The structure of the if-else block is

if check_for_positive_offset :
    offset = decrease_the_value
else :
    offset = increase_the_value
You could check for an offset greater than 10 with offset > 10, for example.
You could increase the offset by 10 with offset = offset + 10.
The printing of "correcting..." should stay at the start of the loop and printing offset should stay at the end of the loop.
Pay close attention to indentation - the if and else should line up with the print() calls, and the changes to offset should be indented further in.

# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0 :
        offset = offset - 1
    else :
        offset = offset + 1
    print(offset)
