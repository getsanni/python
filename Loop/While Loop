#After 3 runs, x will be equal to 4, causing x < 4 to evaluate to False. This means that the while loop is executed 3 times, giving three printouts.
x = 1
while x < 4 :
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

 # Initialize offset
offset = 8

Write offset = 8 outside of the while loop to initialize the offset variable.
The while loop condition is offset != 0. Inside the while loop you need three lines of code.
Make sure the indentation of your code is correct.# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)  
   
   
#Inside the while loop, complete the if-else statement:
If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
Else, you should increase offset by 1.
If you've coded things correctly, hitting Submit Answer should work this time.
If your code is still taking too long to run (or your session is expiring), you probably made a mistake. Check your code and make sure that the statement offset != 0 will eventually evaluate to FALSE!


   
   # Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0 :
        offset = offset - 1
    else :
        offset = offset + 1
    print(offset)
